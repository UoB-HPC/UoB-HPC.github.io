title: LaTeX commands for Performance Portability Metric Symbol
author: Tom Deakin
---

Understanding and enabling Performance Portability is a key research area of the High-Performance Computing Research Group here in Bristol.
We've published a number of articles on the topic, and have been using a metric, originally developed by Pennycook, Sewall and Lee at Intel, to quantify the performance portability of applications.
The metric was first introduced at the [PMBS Supercomputing Workshop](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pmbs/pmbs16//PMBS/papers/paper7.pdf) in 2016, and uses an unusual symbol that looks like a double "PP" character to represent performance portability.
This is a non-standard symbol that is constructed using some LaTeX commands, which are shared below with the permission of the original authors.
Feel free to use this code to generate the symbol.
