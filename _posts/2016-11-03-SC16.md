title: UoBristol HPC group has its most successful SuperComputing conference ever!
author: Simon McIntosh-Smith
---

The **University of Bristol HPC group** has been very successful with submissions being accepted for
[IEEE/ACM SuperComputing in 2016](http://sc16.supercomputing.org).

This year we have research papers in the main track as well as at the PMBS workshop. We're teaching what's turning out to be
one of the most popular tutorials at SC16, all about how to use the new features of OpenMP 4.5 to program GPUs. We have two
poster presentations on some of our exciting work on performance portability and application-based fault tolerance. We're
giving a talk about how to write performance portable OpenMP 4.5 on the OpenMP booth. We have an exhibit in the SC16
Emerging Technologies Showcase. And we're participating in the OpenMP Birds of a Feather session, as well as speaking
at Intel's HPC Developer Conference on the Sunday. For the details on each of these SC'16 contributions, read on.
