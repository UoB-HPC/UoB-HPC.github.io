title: Using the Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) in the HPC Zoo
author: Tom Deakin

The [HPC Zoo](/zoo) has a Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) available. It is a 7210 SKU,
with has 64 cores, and up to 4 hardware threads per core. It has 16 GB MCDRAM
(high bandwidth memory) and 96 GB of DDR DRAM. It is currently configured in the Flat+Quadrant
clustering mode.

## Compiling

Use the Intel compiler, which is available by running `module load intel/2016`.
The 2017 Beta compiler is also available until the license expires.

Use the `-xMIC-AVX512` flag to enable the correct instruction set.

## Running out of MCDRAM

The DDR memory is the default memory space. In order to run your entire application out of
MCDRAM, run as `numactl -m 1 ./a.out`.

## Thread placement

Similar to Xeon CPU architectures, thread numbers 0-63 represent the physical cores.
You can use OpenMP environment variables (`OMP_PROC_BIND` and `OMP_PLACES`) to assist
thread pinning, although generally the default binding is satisfactory.

## Disk access

`/tmp` is hosted on the hard disk, *not* the SSD.
You can use `/data` for temporary fast bulk storage.
