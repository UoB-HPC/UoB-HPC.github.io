The holidays are a common time to review the year just past, and to think about your career for the year to come. If you are passionate about running world-class supercomputers, then we have an amazing opportunity you should consider: the wide range of technical roles we have just announced for Isambard-AI!

The University of Bristol has been awarded over Â£300M to build and run Isambard-AI, one of the world's first supercomputers optimised specifically for Artificial Intelligence and related workflows. Consisting of nearly 5,500 next-generation NVIDIA Grace-Hopper superchips, this HPE-designed system will deliver over 21 ExaFLOP/s of 8-bit compute for AI, and around 250 PetaFLOP/s for traditional HPC workloads. We are now recruiting for permanent technical roles at 3 levels of seniority - lead, specialist and engineer - across areas including SysOps, NetOps, DevOps, SecOps, MLOps and Research Software Engineering.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be involved from the very beginning for a brand-new, Tier 0 leadership class supercomputer, in an exciting new application area. We're looking for the best and brightest in our field, and we're offering permanent roles at generous grades to assemble the best team possible. Check out the engineer, specialist and lead roles at the links below, and please consider applying. We'd love to speak with you about joining our team!
