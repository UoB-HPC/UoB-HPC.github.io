The **University of Bristol HPC research group** is making a lot of contributions to 
[ISC 2017](http://www.isc-hpc.com/overview.html).


## Details of UoB's contributions to ISC 2017

* Prof Simon McIntosh-Smith is giving two talks about [‘Isambard’, the world’s first production ARM-powered supercomputer.](http://gw4.ac.uk/isambard/)
The first Isambard talk is at the invitation only Cray “HPC Innovation Forum”, held on the afternoon of Monday June 19th.
The second talk is at the public [“GoingARM: An HPC oriented workshop for sharing experiences and knowledge”](http://www.goingarm.com), organised by ARM on the morning of Thursday June 22nd.

* Prof McIntosh-Smith will also be contributing to one panel and one birds of a feather session.
The panel is on [“Exascale System Developments”](http://www.isc-hpc.com/isc17_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&o=473&a=select&ra=index) at 13:45 on Tuesday June 20th in room Panorama 1, Messe Frankfurt.
Other panelists at this session include Prof. Satoshi Matsuoka from Tokyo Tech, Dr Al Gara from Intel, Dr Bronis R. de Supinski from LLNL, and Dr John Danskin from NVIDIA.
The BoF session is to celebrate [OpenMP’s 20th anniversary](http://www.isc-hpc.com/isc17_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&o=575&a=select&ra=index), from 15:45 on Wednesday the 21st of June in room Analog 1+2, Messe Frankfurt.


* Tom Deakin will be giving two talks at ISC on research undertaken as part of the Bristol-based Intel Parallel Computing Centre (IPCC).
The first talk is titled “Improving achieved memory bandwidth from C++ codes on Intel Xeon Phi Processor (Knights Landing)” and is at the Intel booth in their Collaboration Hub, on Wednesday June 21st at 14:40.
Tom’s second talk is titled [“On the mitigation of cache hostile memory access patterns on many-core CPU architectures”](https://www.ixpug.org/events/workshop-isc17), and will be presented as part of the Intel Xeon Phi User Group
(IXPUG) workshop on Thursday June 22nd at 14:00 at the Marriott Frankfurt Hotel.


* James Price will be presenting some new results from his research. Titled [“Exploiting auto-tuning to analyze and improve performance portability on many-core architectures”](http://www.csm.ornl.gov/workshops/p3ma2017/agenda.html),
as part of the 2nd International Workshop on Performance Portable Programming Models for Accelerators (P^3MA), at 10:00 on Thursday June 22nd.


We hope to meet many of you at ISC 2017, come and say hello at one of the activities listed above! Most of Bristol's HPC team will be there - 6 of us in total.
