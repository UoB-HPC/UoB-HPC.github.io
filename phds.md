## Ongoing Opportunities with the HPC group in Bristol

The HPC group recruits one or two new PhD students every year. We have a wide range of exciting research opportunities for the best applicants. We collaborate with top HPC sites around the world, and with leading HPC vendors, such as Intel, Arm, Cray, HPE, Cavium, NVIDIA and AMD. Our research spans performance portability, parallel programming languages and standards, fault tolerance, mini-apps, auto-tuning, and more. If you are interested in working with our world-leading group, please contact our head of group, [Prof Simon McIntosh-Smith](mailto:simonm@cs.bris.ac.uk)
