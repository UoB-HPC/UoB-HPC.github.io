## Industrial experience

As a founder at ClearSpeed I had various senior technical roles between 2002 and 2008 including VP of Applications and Director of Architecture. I co-developed the architecture of our record-breaking many-core processors, including the 192 core CSX700, 96 core CSX600, and 64 core CS301 prototype.

At Pixelfusion I was a microprocessor architect and low-level GPU driver developer for our innovative 1,536-core graphics processor, the F150. This was the first fully programmable, true GPGPU, which also included the world's fastest Rambus implementation at the time (4 channels delivering 6.4 GBytes/s, a lot in the year 2000!), and the first commercial implementation of an Arc core. It also pioneered using redundant cores to tolerate manufacturing defects in many-core devices.



## Workshops and Tutorials

I am passionate about equipping the HPC community, university students and industrial partners with high performance computing skills they will need in order to develop fast, efficient and sustainable scientific software which can run on the latest architectures.

To achieve these goals, I run many tutorials and workshops in parallel programming, especially using HPC parallel programming languages such as MPI, OpenMP, Kokkos, OpenCL and so on. In addition to the university courses I run, I also run courses for industrial partners and other academic institutions. Courses can be anything from a 1/2 day introduction, to a 5-day advanced workshop. Please get in touch if you're interested in having such a course run for your group.

I am the creator of the [HandsOnOpenCL]() online course for OpenCL. This course has been accessed over 8,000 unique times as of April 2018.


## Teaching

### Current units

* **Advanced Computer Architecture** with David May (COMSM0109): This course enables you to really understand how processors work and how best to exploit modern processor features from software.

* **Introduction to High Performance Computing** with Gethin Williams (COMS30005): This course takes you through the theory and hands-on practise of high performance computing, using OpenMP and MPI to write codes that will scale across all the cores of a modern high-end server.

* **Advanced High Performance Computing** (COMS30006): This course builds on my Intro to HPC unit, extending to advanced topics such as parallel programming models (MPI+X, GPU programming etc), and applying these to the latest cutting edge computer architectures. 

### Previous units

* **HiTec Enterprise** with Grev Cummins (COMS12900): First year introductory course to innovation and entrepreneurship. This course will equip you with highly marketable skills that will prove valuable through your remaining time in Bristol, and beyond.

* **Individual project business plan**  (COMSM0306): Fourth year course. Advanced topics on how real companies work, innovation, entrepreneurship and transferrable skills. This is one of the top courses of its kind anywhere in the world (we know, we did the benchmarking), and will make you extremely marketable. The skills you learn here will be incredibly valuable throughout your entire career, no matter what kind of roles you choose.
