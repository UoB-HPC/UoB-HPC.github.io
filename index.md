Introduction paragraph

# List of projects

- Development of fully atomistic QM/MM simulations of light harvesting (LH2) complexes found in purple bacteria.  
  Making use of the GPU accelerated quantum chemistry software package [TeraChem](http://www.petachem.com/products.html), we aim to perform the most detailed LH2 calculations ever taken, by scaling the simulation across many GPUs.

- [danceroom Spectroscopy](http://danceroom-spec.com/)  
  OpenCL accelerated interactive real-time molecular dynamics simulations. Using commodity depth sensors such as the LEAP Motion and Microsoft Kinect, we develop artistic and educational platforms allowing the broader public to experience the microscopic world. 

- [BUDE](http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/research/bude)  
  A GPU accelerated molecular docking program that can be used to perform virtual drug screening, ligand binding site identification on protein surfaces, and protein-protein docking in real space. Collaboration with the School of Biochemistry.


- [Oclgrind](https://github.com/jrprice/Oclgrind)  
  An extensible OpenCL device simulator that provides a platform with which various OpenCL developer tools can be created. Includes support for detecting memory access errors, race conditions, work-group divergence, and provides an interactive debugging environment.

- Leveraging Multi-Core Technology for Deterministic Neutral Particle Transport at Extreme Scale  
  An investigation into the parallelism of the Sn transport algorithm on an unstructured, domain decomposed mesh, at the core, node and interconnect level (including accelerated devices such as GPUs) using proxy apps including [SNAP](http://www.lanl.gov/projects/feynman-center/technologies/software/snap-sn.php), [Dockleaf](http://uk-mac.github.io/DockLeaf/) and [Palmleaf](http://uk-mac.github.io/PalmLeaf/).

- [HandsOnOpenCL](http://handsonopencl.github.io/)  
  Hands On OpenCL is a two-day lecture course introducing OpenCL, the API for writing heterogeneous applications. Provided are slides for around twelve lectures, plus some appendices, complete with Examples and Solutions in C, C++ and Python. The lecture series finishes with information on porting CUDA applications to OpenCL.
